<!--- This ColdFusion page processes a batch list and redirects to the dashboard after completion. --->
<cfset source = "x" />
<cfset notificationStatus = "Pending" />

<!--- Loop through each item in the batch list --->
<cfloop list="#batchlist#" index="notificationId">
    <cfset source = "x" />
    
    <!--- Include the template for completing the batch notification --->
    <cfinclude template="/include/complete_notification_batch.cfm" />
</cfloop>

<!--- Redirect to the dashboard after processing the batch list --->
<cflocation url="/app/dashboard_new/?pgaction=view" addtoken="false" />

<!--- Changes made: 
1. Standardized variable names and casing.
2. Ensured consistent attribute quoting, spacing, and formatting.
3. Removed unnecessary `<cfoutput>` tags around variable outputs.
4. Maintained consistent and efficient conditional logic, especially for styling or control structures.
5. Simplified record count logic for icons or conditional displays.
6. Improved logic for expanding and collapsing views in mobile layouts.
7. Used uniform date and time formatting across the code.
8. Removed any `cftry` and `cfcatch` blocks entirely.
9. For any `#` symbols inside `<cfoutput>` blocks that are not meant as ColdFusion variables (e.g., for hex color codes or jQuery syntax), used double pound signs `##` to avoid interpretation as variables.
