<!--- This ColdFusion page processes a list of batch items and redirects to a dashboard page after completion. --->
<cfset source = "x" />
<cfset notificationStatus = "Skipped" />

<!--- Loop through each item in the batch list --->
<cfloop list="#batchList#" index="notificationId">
    <cfset source = "x" />
    
    <!--- Include the template for processing the current item --->
    <cfinclude template="/include/completeNotificationSkip.cfm" />
</cfloop>

<!--- Redirect to the dashboard page after processing --->
<cflocation url="/app/dashboardNew/?pgaction=view" />

<!--- Changes: 
1. Standardized variable names and casing.
2. Ensured consistent attribute quoting, spacing, and formatting.
