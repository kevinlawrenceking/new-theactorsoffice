<p>Create a view from this query</p>

<p>Ignore the order by and don't include</p>

<p>Every column must be prefixed with its table alias to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<p>When joins are involved, all columns should be fully qualified with their corresponding table aliases.</p>


<p>Ensure that all columns used in the WHERE clause are included in the SELECT statement of the view. For example, 
if the query is SELECT id, name FROM table WHERE userid = #userid#, the view should be created as 
SELECT id, name, userid FROM table to allow filtering on userid in the future.</p>

<p>***IMPORTANT*** After generating the query, **automatically remove any duplicate columns** 
that are listed multiple times. For example, if `a.audroleid` and `ad.audroleid` are both in the 
SELECT statement, only keep one of them.

<p>come up with a name for the view making it "vm_" + qry_table + "_" + a secondary table name to make the view name unique</p>
